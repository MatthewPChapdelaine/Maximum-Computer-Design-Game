## Research System

### How Research Works
1. Select an unresearched component
2. Click "🔬 Start Research"
3. Wait for research to complete (real-time progress)
4. Component becomes available for purchase

### Research Times
- Basic components: 5-15 seconds
- Mid-tier: 30-60 seconds
- High-end: 90-120 seconds
- Ultimate: 180-360 seconds

### Prerequisites
Most components require owning previous tier components:
- Must own "Budget CPU" before researching "Mid-Range CPU"
- Must own "Mid-Range CPU" before researching "High-End CPU"
- Prerequisites prevent skipping tiers
- Plan your research path carefully

- Research multiple components simultaneously is not possible (only one at a time)
- Save before major purchases
- Balance spending across categories

### Power Planning
- Always have PSU headroom
- Calculate power before buying components
- Ultimate build needs 24kW PSU first
- High-end GPUs use 700-1000W each!

### Optimal Progression Path
1. Basic infrastructure first
2. Upgrade PSU before power-hungry components
3. Don't neglect cooling
4. Save up for big purchases rather than incremental buys
5. Research ahead to plan your upgrade path

### Time Management
- Research completes faster for basic components
- Ultimate components take 3-6 minutes to research
- Plan research queue in your head
- Use waiting time to accumulate resources

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Buying components without adequate power
- Skipping infrastructure upgrades
- Ignoring prerequisites
- Not saving regularly
- Spending all money immediately
