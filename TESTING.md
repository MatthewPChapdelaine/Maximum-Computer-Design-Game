## Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Launch
**Issue**: Command not found
- **Solution**: Check PATH or use full path `/usr/bin/maximum-pc-builder`

**Issue**: Python error on launch
- **Solution**: Verify Python 3.8+ is installed: `python3 --version`

**Issue**: Tkinter import error
- **Solution**: Install python3-tk: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

### UI Issues
**Issue**: Window too small or text cut off
- **Solution**: Resize window manually, minimum recommended: 1200x800

**Issue**: Colors look wrong
- **Solution**: Verify display supports 24-bit color

### Gameplay Issues
**Issue**: Research not progressing
- **Solution**: Ensure game window has focus and game loop is running

**Issue**: Can't purchase component
- **Solution**: Check money, power budget, and prerequisites

**Issue**: Save file not loading
- **Solution**: Check file exists and has valid JSON: `cat ~/.maximum_pc_game_save.json`

### Build Issues
**Issue**: .deb build fails
- **Solution**: Check dpkg-deb is installed: `sudo apt-get install dpkg`

**Issue**: Permission denied on scripts
- **Solution**: Make scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh`
